Function: extract_features(image_path)
Purpose: Extracts a feature vector from an image using the ResNet50 model.

1. img = image.load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
   - Loads the image from the given file path.
   - Resizes the image to 224x224 pixels (required input size for ResNet50).

2. img_data = image.img_to_array(img)
   - Converts the image to a numerical format (NumPy array) that the model can process.

3. img_data = np.expand_dims(img_data, axis=0)
   - Adds an extra dimension to the array to create a batch of size 1.
   - Deep learning models expect a batch input, even if it contains only one image.

4. img_data = preprocess_input(img_data)
   - Prepares the image by applying the same preprocessing used during ResNet50 training.
   - Adjusts pixel values and color channels.

5. features = model.predict(img_data)
   - Passes the image through the pre-trained ResNet50 model.
   - Gets the feature vector from the last layer (without the classification part).

6. return features.flatten()
   - Flattens the output from 2D to 1D (e.g., from (1, 2048) to (2048,)).
   - This 1D array represents the image features (a kind of "digital signature").

Summary: This function converts an image into a set of 2048 numbers that describe the image content,
which can be used to compare it with other images.
